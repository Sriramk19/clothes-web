## Frontend

Front end is deployed in Vercel

## Backend Wait time:

The backend is deployed on Render, a cloud hosting platform.

Render uses an idle-to-active scaling mechanism to optimize costs. When the backend remains inactive for a certain period, it enters an idle state. Upon the first request after idling, Render performs a cold start to bring the service online, which typically takes ~15 seconds. Subsequent requests are served without delay until the service idles again.
